# Embedded Systems Software Foundations

This repository documents my hands-on learning in embedded systems
software development.

## Scope
- Embedded software development workflow
- GCC compilation and GNU Make build systems
- Embedded memory types and segments
- Linux-based development environment

This repository will be updated progressively as I complete coursework
and implement practical examples.
